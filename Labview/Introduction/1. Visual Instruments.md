<h3>1.1 Virtual Instruments</h3>
<p>LabVIEW is similar to Java, the VIs are are compiled into an executable code that LabVIEW's execution engine processes during runtime.</p>
<p>Virtual Instrument (VI) is consisted of a front panel, block diagram, and an icon.<br>
  <h4>1) Front panel<br></h4>
    It is used to <b>display</b> controls and indicators for the user.<br>
  <h4>2) Block diagram<br></h4>
    It contains the code for the VI.<br>
  <h4>3) Icon<br></h4>
    Virtual expression of inputs and outputs.<br>
</p>
<h4>How to execute</h4>
<p>A LabVIEW program is executed by pressing the arrow or the Run button. When the error occured during compile time, an error list window will appear.</p>
